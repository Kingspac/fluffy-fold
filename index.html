                            Therefore, the function keeps a work list. This is an array of places that
                            should be explored next, along with the route that got us there. It starts with
                            just the start position and an empty route.
                            The search then operates by taking the next item in the list and exploring
                            that, which means all roads going from that place are looked at. If one of them
                            is the goal, a finished route can be returned. Otherwise, if we haven’t looked
                            at this place before, a new item is added to the list. If we have looked at it
                            before, since we are looking at short routes first, we’ve found either a longer
                            route to that place or one precisely as long as the existing one, and we don’t
                            need to explore it.
                            You can visually imagine this as a web of known routes crawling out from the
                            start location, growing evenly on all sides (but never tangling back into itself).
                            As soon as the first thread reaches the goal location, that thread is traced back
                            to the start, giving us our route.
                            Our code doesn’t handle the situation where there are no more work items
                            on the work list because we know that our graph is connected, meaning that
                            every location can be reached from all other locations. We’ll always be able to
                            find a route between two points, and the search can’t fail.

                        NPM is two things: an online service where one can download (and upload)
                        packages and a program (bundled with Node.js) that helps you install and
                        manage them.
                        At the time of writing, there are more than half a million different packages
                        available on NPM. A large portion of those are rubbish, I should mention,
                        but almost every useful, publicly available package can be found on there. For
                        example, an INI file parser, similar to the one we built in Chapter 9, is available
                        under the package name ini.
                        Chapter 20 will show how to install such packages locally using the npm
                        command line program.
                        Having quality packages available for download is extremely valuable. It
                        means that we can often avoid reinventing a program that 100 people have
                        written before and get a solid, well-tested implementation at the press of a few
                        keys.
                        Software is cheap to copy, so once someone has written it, distributing it to
                        other people is an efficient process. But writing it in the first place is work,
                        and responding to people who have found problems in the code, or who want
                        to propose new features, is even more work.
                        By default, you own the copyright to the code you write, and other people may use it only with your permission. But because some people are just
                        nice and because publishing good software can help make you a little bit famous among programmers, many packages are published under a license that
                        explicitly allows other people to use it.
                        Most code on NPM is licensed this way. Some licenses require you to also
                        publish code that you build on top of the package under the same license.
                        Others are less demanding, just requiring that you keep the license with the
                        code as you distribute it. The JavaScript community mostly uses the latter
                        type of license. When using other people’s packages, make sure you are aware
                        of their license.

                        The async name => part shows that arrow functions can also be made async
                        by putting the word async in front of them.
                        The code doesn’t immediately look suspicious...it maps the async arrow function over the set of nests, creating an array of promises, and then uses Promise
                        .all to wait for all of these before returning the list they build up.
                        But it is seriously broken. It’ll always return only a single line of output,
                        listing the nest that was slowest to respond.
                        Can you work out why?
                        The problem lies in the += operator, which takes the current value of list
                        at the time where the statement starts executing and then, when the await
                        finishes, sets the list binding to be that value plus the added string.
                        But between the time where the statement starts executing and the time
                        where it finishes there’s an asynchronous gap. The map expression runs before
                        anything has been added to the list, so each of the += operators starts from an
                        empty string and ends up, when its storage retrieval finishes, setting list to a
                        single-line list—the result of adding its line to the empty string.
                        This could have easily been avoided by returning the lines from the mapped
                        promises and calling join on the result of Promise.all, instead of building
                        up the list by changing a binding. As usual, computing new values is less
                        error-prone than changing existing values.
